Hi everyone,
In this project I use inverse indexing.
If you want to search something in your data or if I say a lot of data you get easily with this process just need to put your data folder in src folder and run the indexer_1.py file.and I use skilling-j folder as data.you can choose any other just need to change file path.

Actually it's lot of file in skilling-j that's why that folder not in this src folder.
Thank you
